(Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore.",5)
("'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--,1)
("'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--,1)
("Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--,1)
("Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,,1)
("Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!,1)
("Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!,1)
("Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--,1)
("Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;,1)
("Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;,1)
("Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,,1)
("Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee,1)
('Tis the wind and nothing more.,1)
(Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,,1)
(And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.,1)
(And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,1)
(And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor,1)
(And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,,1)
(And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,1)
(And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;,1)
(And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?",1)
(And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain,1)
(As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.,1)
(Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,,1)
(Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,,1)
(But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,,1)
(But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only,1)
(But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,,1)
(But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,,1)
(But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,1)
(But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--,1)
(By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--,1)
(By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,,1)
(Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster,1)
(Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.",1)
(Darkness there and nothing more.,1)
(Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,,1)
(Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--,1)
(Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;,1)
(Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow,1)
(Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--,1)
(Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--,1)
(Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--,1)
(For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--,1)
(For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being,1)
(From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--,1)
(Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--,1)
(In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.,1)
(Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!",1)
(It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--,1)
(Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!,1)
(Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!,1)
(Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--,1)
(Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--,1)
(Meant in croaking "Nevermore.",1)
(Merely this and nothing more.,1)
(Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,,1)
(Nameless here for evermore.,1)
(Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,,1)
(Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--,1)
(Of 'Never--nevermore.'",1)
(On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,,1)
(On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.",1)
(On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;,1)
(On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--,1)
(Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,,1)
(Only this and nothing more.",1)
(Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,,1)
(Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--,1)
(Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--,1)
(Perched, and sat, and nothing more.,1)
(Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,,1)
(Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!",1)
(Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!,1)
(Shall be lifted--nevermore!,1)
(She shall press, ah, nevermore!,1)
(So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,1)
(Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;,1)
(Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.,1)
(Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,,1)
(Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;,1)
(Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.,1)
(Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!",1)
(Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!",1)
(Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,,1)
(That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door--,1)
(That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour,1)
(Then the bird said "Nevermore.",1)
(Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,,1)
(Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,1)
(Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking,1)
(This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing,1)
(This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"--,1)
(This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining,1)
(This it is and nothing more.",1)
(Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;,1)
(Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;,1)
(Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before--,1)
(Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore,1)
(To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;,1)
(What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,1)
(Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,,1)
(While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,,1)
(With such name as "Nevermore.",1)
